Used https://cobbl.io/ to make the Customer.csv File.

Used https://www.mockaroo.com/ to make the Orders.csv File.

The goal of this project was to created a Database Infrastructure using SQL and Talend for a Startup Company. I chose an artist drawing fanart and making plushies. There are two tables in the Database, one for the Customer Contact Information and the other for the Order Imformation. I used the Phone Number as the Customer ID to connect the information of the two tables.

I made a Stored Procedure of the items not yet made. I included the Phone Number, so it could be used to look up the Mailing Address when it is complete. The name of the person was included, so the artist knows who it is for, and naturally, the fandom and what kind of art was requested.
